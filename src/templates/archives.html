            <p>The legendary, ODETTA and Robert Sims the Gold Medal Winner of the 
                American<br>
                Traditions Vocal Competition have joined forces in duo concert performances 
                of spirituals, freedom songs, folk songs and work songs. Their concerts 
                celebrate the rich history and artistry found in this important American 
                music, and explore in song the faith, hope, joy, protest and double and 
                triple meanings contained within.<br>
                ODETTA, described by The New York Times as one of the most influential
                artists of the 20th Century and honored with scores of awards, has enjoyed a
                50 year career including movie and stage acting, story telling, singing and
                performing protest songs for civil rights movements with Dr. Martin Luther
                King Jr.<br>
                Robert Sims, called by the Chicago Tribune "...Stunning, Dazzling and
                Sublime...", is highly regarded for his "moving" and "authentic"
                interpretations of African American spirituals and folk songs, and has given
                recitals of spirituals throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.
                It is no wonder why these two extraordinary artists' performances have been
                greeted with standing ovations from San Franciso on the west coast to New
                York' Carnegie Hall on the east coast.</p><br>
