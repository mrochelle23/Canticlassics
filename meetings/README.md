Consequently, we shifted our project focus from developing a Mackinac Pacman game to enhancing the Canticlassics website. 
- We talked about functional specifications: what they are, how they work, and how to create them. Additionally, we discussed wireframes, their purpose, and how to develop them. We set up accounts on Figma and created a collaborative team document.
